# SPAM Filtering Modelling for Youtube
This project focuses on developing a spam detection model for YouTube comments. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of YouTube comments and can classify comments as either spam or legitimate.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the algorithm is a collection of YouTube comments that have been labeled as either 1(spam) or 0(legitimate). The dataset is relatively small with approx 2000 tuples.
