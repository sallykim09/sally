# SPAM Filtering Modelling for Youtube
This project focuses on developing a spam detection model for YouTube comments. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of YouTube comments and can classify comments as either spam or legitimate.

## Dataset
The data set is collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is a public set of comments collected for spam research. It has five datasets composed by 1,956 real messages extracted from five videos that were among the 10 most viewed on the collection period. The dataset used for training and testing the algorithm is a collection of YouTube comments that have been labeled as either 1(spam) or 0(legitimate).
